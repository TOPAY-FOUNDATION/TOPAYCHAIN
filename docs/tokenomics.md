# TOPAYCHAIN Tokenomics

**TOPAYCHAIN** incorporates a robust tokenomics model to manage the distribution, utility, and governance of its native token, **TPY**. The total supply is capped at **120 million TPY** tokens, ensuring scarcity and long-term value.

## Token Distribution

The total supply of **120 million TPY** is allocated as follows:

| **Category**           | **Allocation**      | **Description**                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Foundation Reserve** | 30% (36M TPY)      | Reserved for the TOPAYCHAIN Foundation to support project development, marketing, and operations. |
| **Community Rewards**  | 25% (30M TPY)      | Distributed through staking rewards, mining incentives, and community engagement programs. |
| **Ecosystem Growth**   | 20% (24M TPY)      | Allocated for partnerships, grants, and developer incentives to expand the ecosystem. |
| **Public Sale**        | 15% (18M TPY)      | Made available during the token sale event to raise funds for project growth. |
| **Team & Advisors**    | 10% (12M TPY)      | Reserved for the team and advisors with a vesting schedule to ensure long-term commitment. |

## Utility of TPY Tokens

### 1. **Transaction Fees**
   - TPY is used to pay transaction fees within the blockchain network.
   - Fees are dynamically adjusted based on network activity.

### 2. **Staking**
   - Validators stake TPY tokens to participate in the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.
   - Stakers earn rewards proportional to their stake and the number of blocks validated.

### 3. **Governance**
   - TPY holders can participate in on-chain governance by voting on proposals, protocol upgrades, and network changes.

### 4. **Ecosystem Access**
   - Used within decentralized applications (DApps) built on TOPAYCHAIN.
   - Facilitates interactions such as payments, subscriptions, and smart contract execution.

## Staking Rewards

Staking rewards incentivize validators to maintain the network. Rewards are distributed from the **Community Rewards** pool:

- **Annual Yield**: 5-12% (varies based on staking participation and network conditions).
- **Lock-in Period**: Stakers must lock their tokens for a minimum of 30 days to earn rewards.

---

## Governance Model

Governance ensures decentralization and community-driven decision-making:

1. **Voting Power**:
   - Each TPY token represents one vote.
   - Voting power is proportional to the number of tokens held or staked.

2. **Proposal Submission**:
   - Any TPY holder can submit proposals for improvements or changes.
   - Proposals require a minimum TPY stake to be considered.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Approved proposals are implemented through smart contracts or network upgrades.

## Deflationary Mechanisms

To maintain scarcity and long-term value, TOPAYCHAIN includes the following deflationary features:

1. **Burn Mechanism**:
   - A portion of transaction fees is burned, permanently reducing the circulating supply.

2. **Halving Events**:
   - Staking rewards are reduced periodically to decrease token inflation.

## Vesting Schedule

To ensure sustainable growth and prevent market manipulation, tokens allocated to the **Team & Advisors** follow a vesting schedule:

- **Cliff Period**: 12 months.
- **Vesting Duration**: 48 months.
- **Release Frequency**: Quarterly.

## Conclusion

TOPAYCHAIN’s tokenomics model ensures fair distribution, long-term sustainability, and a strong incentive structure for participants. The cap of **120 million TPY** tokens creates scarcity, while utility and governance features empower the community to drive the platform’s growth and evolution.
