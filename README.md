## Features

- **Blockchain Core**:
  - Immutable ledger for secure and transparent transactions.
  - Efficient state management for balances and tokenomics.

- **Wallet System**:
  - Secure wallet creation, recovery, and management.
  - Digital signature support for transaction signing.

- **Consensus Algorithms**:
  - Proof of Stake (PoS) for energy efficiency.
  - Flexible support for other consensus mechanisms.

- **Utility Token**:
  - Integrated tokenomics for managing balances and transaction fees.
  - Rewards system for miners and validators.

- **P2P Networking**:
  - Seamless peer-to-peer node communication.
  - Blockchain synchronization for decentralized integrity.

- **API Integration**:
  - RESTful API for external interactions.
  - Middleware for authentication and logging.

- **Persistence and Scalability**:
  - File-based and database storage options.
  - Cache layer for improved performance.

- **Smart Contract Support** *(Future Goal)*:
  - Enable DApp development and execution of decentralized logic.
